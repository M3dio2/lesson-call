//   state vector and the other replies with exactly what is missing. This works both ways,
//   so whoever has the newer content, nothing is lost.
// `acceptUpdate` can drop live edits from a participant (the teacher uses it to ignore the
// student while editing is off). Full-state diffs are always accepted so a refreshed
// page can recover from the peer.
